> You cannot step into the same river twice - Heraclitus

This quote from the ancient and obscure Greek philosopher Heraclitus, highlights one of the most fundamental properties of Nature. The only constant in the Universe is change. Everything changes, nothing stays the same. Perhaps we can imagine something static in space, but we cannot imagine something static in time, not until we know what happens inside black holes.

The irreversability of time is a fundamental breaking of symmetry of the Universe. This irreversability imposes that the future cannot be like the past. Everything is transient and on a long enough timeline everyone survival rate drops to zero, even survival of the Universe itself. 

This creates a fundamental problem to the human condition, because Humans survive on certainty. In fact, survival is by definition the fight against change. Survival is the ability to identify some degree of certainty in a sea of change that allows to predict the future, and come up with an action plan. Run from probable predators, engage with probable mates, etc.

So, it's only natural that humans resist change in all its forms. This resistance is so natural that we strive continously to reach the ultimate certainty. The One thing that is immutable and absolute that will never change and help us in our quest for survival. This is the origin source for all religions.

Perhaps the most important teachings of the Buddha, is that there is no such thing. There is an [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81) at the heart of reality. Even the fundamental blocks of Nature [decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay) into nothingness. We are condemned to [suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence) if we cling to impernament things, and the only path to enlightnement and Nirvana is to abandon all hope of certainty and embrace change.

These ideas have 25 centuries but they have not yet fully percolate into the modern scientific view. There is still a tendency to look at entities as "static things" instead of actual dynamical processes. Whitehead in his book ["Process and Reality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_and_Reality), tries to make the distinction between this different views, arguing that when we see John as a baby, as a child or as an adult, what we see as a permanent John is an abstraction of the underlying dynamical material proccess. John as an entity has no physical meaning. I think that Prigogine said it better, when he said that we should change from a [*"physics of being"* to a *"physics of becoming"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy)

Recently I've read the book [Everything Flows](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Flows-Towards-Processual-Philosophy/dp/0198779631) and it tries to give another shot to this worldview arguing that we should stop to look at organisms as complex machines but instead as flowing streams. To me the most fascinating thing about this worldview of looking at living beings as flowing streams that diferentiate in space and time, is that it allows you to see the big picture. That we are all part of this unified process we call Life.

To understand this process flow, I implemented a basic fluid simulator in WebGPU. I used the classic [paper](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf) by Jos Stam, and Karl Sims has a nice [visual tutorial](https://www.karlsims.com/fluid-flow.html) on how everthing works.
