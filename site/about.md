# About 

What is morphopoiesis ?

It is a pace to explore digital [morphogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis). The word *morphogenesis* is built with the prefix *morpho* meaning **form** in greek, and the suffix *genesis* meaning **origin**. So the word literally means **the origin of form** .

There are many scientist in history that asked themselves, *"Where does form comes from?"* *"What are the rules that allow the creation of patterns that we see in nature?"*. Two of the most famous ones are [Darcy Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Arcy_Wentworth_Thompson) with its book ["On Growth and Form"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Growth_and_Form) and [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) with its article ["The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis). In its article, Turing gave an answer in the form of a mathematical model of pattern generation, called a [reaction-diffusion system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system). 

Today, with all the compute power that is available to us, these models are able to be run in real-time. So, this is a place to explore these computer models of pattern generation, and generate little works of art in the process.
