# Project Brief: Morphopoiesis

## Overview

Morphopoiesis is a web-based platform exploring the intersection of art, science, and technology through interactive visualizations. The name "morphopoiesis" combines "morpho" (form) and "poiesis" (creation/formation), reflecting the project's focus on the synthesis and emergence of form through computational processes.

## Core Purpose

To create an interactive notebook and gallery of generative art pieces that visualize complex mathematical, physical, and biological processes using WebGPU technology. The project serves as both an artistic exploration and an educational resource for understanding emergent patterns and forms in nature.

## Key Objectives

1. **Visualization**: Create visually compelling representations of complex systems and mathematical concepts
2. **Interactivity**: Allow users to manipulate parameters and interact with simulations in real-time
3. **Education**: Provide context and explanation for the scientific principles behind each visualization
4. **Exploration**: Enable discovery of emergent patterns and behaviors through experimentation
5. **Performance**: Leverage WebGPU for high-performance graphics processing in the browser

## Target Audience

- Digital artists interested in generative and algorithmic art
- Students and educators in mathematics, physics, and computer science
- Researchers exploring complex systems and emergent behaviors
- General audience with interest in the intersection of art and science

## Core Features

1. **Shader Gallery**: A collection of WebGPU shaders demonstrating various phenomena
   - Fractals and complex systems
   - Cellular automata and agent-based models
   - Physical simulations (fluids, particles)
   - Biological pattern formation

2. **Interactive Controls**: Real-time parameter adjustment for each visualization
   - Mouse interaction for direct manipulation
   - Parameter sliders and controls
   - Ability to save and share configurations

3. **Educational Context**: Explanatory notes and background for each visualization
   - Scientific principles and mathematical foundations
   - Historical context and applications
   - References to related research

4. **Technical Framework**: A robust WebGPU-based rendering system
   - Custom shader library (Poiesis)
   - Efficient compute and render pipelines
   - Modular architecture for adding new visualizations

## Success Criteria

1. A diverse collection of at least 30 different interactive visualizations
2. Smooth performance across modern browsers that support WebGPU
3. Intuitive user interface that encourages exploration
4. Comprehensive documentation of both artistic and scientific aspects
5. Growing community engagement and contributions

## Project Constraints

1. **Technical**: Limited to browsers and devices that support WebGPU
2. **Scope**: Focus on 2D and 3D visualizations that can run in real-time in a browser
3. **Complexity**: Balance between visual appeal and educational value
4. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time interaction on consumer hardware

## Future Directions

1. Community contributions and open-source collaboration
2. Integration with machine learning for parameter exploration
3. VR/AR extensions for immersive experiences
4. Workshops and educational programs based on the platform
5. Publication of research and artistic outcomes
